Overview
---

In this project, I used the dataset collected from the 1994 U.S Census to create a supervised learning model which was able to predict if an individual make more or less than $50k income per year. The idea is to target individuals making more than 50k which are more probable to donate money for a ficticious company called CharityML. The company is dedicated to offer scholarships to students interested going deeply in Machine Learning skills in California. 

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". Udacity made small changes to the original datasets for educational purposes.
