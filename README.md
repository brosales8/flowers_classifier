Overview
---

The goal of the project is to create a classifier to correctly predict the class of 102 types of flowers (images) provided by `oxford102-dataset`. The problem was approached using a Neural Network pretrained `MobileNetv2.0 - Transfering Learning` and training it on the new dataset. The dataset was preprocessing to resize images and also data augmentation was required to avoid overfitting due by the number of samples in training dataset.
